            <p>Hi, my name's David. <br><br>

                I created this website to study Ukrainian.<br><br>

                The corpus of this website was made based in a list of the 40k most used words in Ukrainian, you can see
                it
                here: <a
                    href="https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists/Ukrainian/Mixed_(2012-2022)">LINK</a><br><br>
                Then I took a list of words I found on internet which was taken from lcorp: <a
                    href="https://lcorp.ulif.org.ua/dictua/">LINK</a><br><br>
                Then I crossed both lists. Unfortunatelly, this second list didn't have some very common words like,
                після
                and розмовляю, which I added manually.<br><br>
                Therefore, if you enter a word with more than 2 vowels and it doesn't return with a stress mark, please
                let
                me know here: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/david.com.d.de.david/">LINK</a><br><br>
                Also, if you have any problem using the site, let me know in the same link
                You see some words return with two variants, like тебе́|те́бе. It means that such word has two possible
                stressed syllables. You should check it in a dictionary to be sure which one to use, because sometimes
                it's
                a difference in the declension case, or even a different word, or just a question of preference of the
                speaker.<br><br>
                The website removes punctuation markers (, . ? ! etc). This is so the program can check the word in the
                corpus.<br><br>
                I hope this website can be useful in your studies of Ukrainian.<br><br>
